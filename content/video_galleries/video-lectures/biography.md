Prof. Lerman was one of the principal investigators of the Networked Multimedia Information Services (NMIS) Project at MIT. This four year program developed one of the largest on-line repositories of digital video. Research in the NMIS project created one of the earliest streaming video players for the Internet, technology that enables soft segmentation of MPEG-1 clips, and an innovative, SGML-based markup language for temporal media.

Steven R. Lerman received his Bachelors, Masters and PhD degrees from MIT in 1972, 1973 and 1975 respectively.

{{< anchor "mr" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Mary Rudder

Mary Rudder is a teacher in the Boston Public Schools System who has taught children from k1 level to grade 8. Her current assignment is at the Harvard Kent School in their Kindergarten program. Mrs. Rudder is a lead/mentor teacher and has held the positions of Science and English Language Arts Facilitator for her school. She is an active member of the school's Math and Instructional Leadership Teams. She has been involved in the Boston Women's Heritage Trail, the Charlestown Women's Walk and is an advisory member to the curriculum project for the new Women's Memorial in Boston. Linking herself to the future, she was one of Boston's original LINC pioneers, a program, which used computer technology to enhance curriculum. Her project was a unit on Japan. As a pioneer she was responsible for successfully guiding several colleagues through similar projects. This led to her working with the other Kindergarten as a coach and creator of curriculum units, which used technology as major component. Mrs. Rudder has presented technology workshop citywide. A trip to Japan, which had been the end result of a yearlong study, sparked an interest in cultures that were vastly different from her own. Returning to her class she worked on a curriculum project about Japan and began its use in her class. This led her to use the StarFestival CD-ROM with her class. Mary Rudder feels that it is important for her students to be able to recognize similarities and differences between cultures and to respect those cultures. She feels that it is essential to encourage these attitudes in young children.

{{< anchor "jb" >}}{{< /anchor >}}John Belcher

Professor Belcher was born in Louisiana in 1943, and graduated from Odessa High School in West Texas in 1961. He attended Rice University in Houston, graduating with a double major in math and physics in 1965, summa cum laude. He then went to Caltech for graduate school where he earned his Ph.D. in Physics in 1971.

Professor Belcher came to MIT in 1971, to work with Professors Herbert Bridge and Alan Lazarus, who had the plasma probe on board Mariner 5. Just after he arrived, the Space Plasma Group wrote a proposal for the Voyager mission to Jupiter and Saturn. After reaching these two planets, as well as Uranus and Neptune, Voyager is still going strong. In its most recent incarnation, it is refered to as the Voyager Interstellar Mission. Within the next twenty years, it is probable that the MIT plasma instrument on Voyager 2 will make measurements in the interstellar medium.

Professor Belcher has twice received the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal, once for contributions to the understanding of the plasma dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere, in 1980, and once for his role as principal investigator on the Plasma Science Experiment on Voyager during the Neptune encounter, in 1990.

Professor Belcher's research interests are within the areas of space plasma physics, outer planet magnetospheres, solar wind in the outer heliosphere, and astrophysical plasmas. He was the principal investigator on the Voyager Plasma Science Experiment during the Voyager Nepture Encounter—the end of the Grand Tour. He is now a co-investigator on the Plasma Science Experiment on board the Voyager Interstellar Mission.
